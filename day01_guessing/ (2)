## The computer or python code randomly generates a number and notifies the user to guess a number

  
##The user guesses the number and the program checks it the guessed input number is equal to the randomly generated number
import random
import flask

app=Flask(_name_)


@app.route(/'play_game', methods = ['POST'])
def play_game():
	a = random.randrange(1,2)
	for i in range(5):
		#b =int(input())
		data = request.get_json()
		b = data('b')
		if a == b:
		  return jsonify('Correct')
	   #	print("Correct")
		elif a > b:
			return jsonify('Lower')
		#	print("lower")
		elif a < b:
			return jsonify('Higher')
			#print("higher")	
		else:
			return jsonify('No Number inputtrd')
			#print("no number inputted")



	
    


##If it's equal to the number, print “correct”


##If it is greater than the number print “High”  or “Too High” based on the level 
##If it is lower than the number print “low” or “lower” 


##Limit the number of tries to five - loop
##There should be a condition to check if no number was inputted and put 0 
##There should be a message that shows you cant try again
